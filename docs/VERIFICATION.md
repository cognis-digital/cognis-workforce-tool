# Deployment Verification Guide for Evolution Architecture

This document outlines the steps and procedures to verify that the Evolution Architecture has been correctly deployed and is functioning properly across all environments.

## Pre-verification Requirements

- Access to both staging and production environments
- Administrator credentials
- API testing tools (Postman, cURL, etc.)
- Browser developer tools

## Component Verification Checklist

### 1. Time-Series State Management

#### Verification Steps:

1. **User Profile State Testing**:
   ```javascript
   // Open browser console and execute
   const { current, history } = window.cognisApp.userCredentialsStore.getState();
   console.log('Current state:', current);
   console.log('History entries:', history.length);
   ```
   
   Expected result: Console should display the current state object and a history array with at least one entry.

2. **Snapshot Creation and Loading**:
   ```javascript
   // Create a snapshot
   window.cognisApp.userCredentialsStore.getState().createSnapshot('test-snapshot');
   
   // Make some changes
   window.cognisApp.updateUserPreferences({ theme: 'dark' });
   
   // Load the snapshot
   window.cognisApp.userCredentialsStore.getState().loadSnapshot('test-snapshot');
   
   // Verify state reverted
   console.log(window.cognisApp.userCredentialsStore.getState().current.preferences.theme);
   ```
   
   Expected result: Theme should revert to the value before the change.

### 2. Polymorphic Code Generation

#### Verification Steps:

1. **Code Generation API Check**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://{API_URL}/api/evolution/generate-code \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer {TOKEN}" \
     -d '{
       "template": "componentTemplate",
       "data": {
         "componentName": "TestComponent",
         "props": ["title", "description"]
       }
     }'
   ```
   
   Expected result: API should return generated TypeScript code for a React component.

2. **Type Generation Verification**:
   Navigate to the Evolution Dashboard and check the "Code Generation" tab for recent type generations.

### 3. State Analysis Engine

#### Verification Steps:

1. **Pattern Detection Check**:
   ```javascript
   // Open browser console and execute
   const insights = window.cognisApp.stateAnalysisEngine.getInsights();
   console.log('Optimization suggestions:', insights.optimizationSuggestions);
   console.log('Detected patterns:', insights.frequentPatterns);
   ```
   
   Expected result: Should display any detected patterns and optimization suggestions.

2. **Anomaly Detection Check**:
   Review the anomalies section in the Evolution Dashboard for any detected anomalies.

### 4. Adaptive UI Components

#### Verification Steps:

1. **Component Adaptation Check**:
   - Navigate through the application and interact with multiple components
   - Open browser console and check for adaptation events:
   ```javascript
   console.log(window.cognisApp.evolutionManager.getEvolutionHistory({
     startTime: Date.now() - 3600000 // Last hour
   }));
   ```
   
   Expected result: History should show component adaptations based on usage.

2. **Visual Verification**:
   Components with higher usage should show optimizations in their UI (simplified interfaces, more prominent actions).

### 5. RBAC System

#### Verification Steps:

1. **Permission Check**:
   ```javascript
   // Open browser console and execute as admin
   const hasAccess = window.cognisApp.hasPermission('current-user@example.com', 'manage_users');
   console.log('Access to manage users:', hasAccess);
   ```
   
   Expected result: Should return true for admin users and false for non-admin users.

2. **Role Assignment Check**:
   - Assign a new role to a test user
   - Verify the role appears in the user's profile
   - Check the audit trail shows the assignment

### 6. Blockchain Integration

#### Verification Steps:

1. **Wallet Connection**:
   - Click "Connect Wallet" button
   - Verify wallet connection with test network
   - Check blockchain status in status bar

2. **Transaction Verification**:
   - Create a knowledge base document with blockchain verification enabled
   - Verify transaction appears in "Recent Blockchain Activity"
   - Check transaction hash resolves on testnet explorer

## Full Application Flow Tests

### 1. User Profile Evolution Test

1. Update user profile multiple times
2. Check version history is tracked
3. Revert to a previous version
4. Verify the profile data correctly reverts

### 2. AI Chat Interface with Temporal Snapshots

1. Start a new chat conversation
2. Send multiple messages
3. Create a temporal snapshot
4. Continue the conversation
5. Revert to the snapshot
6. Verify conversation history reverts correctly

### 3. Knowledge Stack with Versioning

1. Create a new knowledge base
2. Upload a test document
3. Verify document is processed and embedded
4. Create a new version of the document
5. Verify version history is maintained
6. Test blockchain verification if enabled

### 4. Lead Generation with Recursive Pattern Matching

1. Configure search parameters
2. Generate leads
3. Verify lead scores reflect search criteria
4. Test recursive lead qualification
5. Check state transitions are recorded

## Performance Verification

1. **Time-Series Store Performance**:
   - Check memory usage during state transitions
   - Verify history pruning works correctly
   - Test with large state objects

2. **Adaptation Performance**:
   - Measure response times before and after adaptations
   - Verify UI optimizations improve interaction speed

## Error Case Testing

1. **Snapshot Failure Recovery**:
   - Attempt to load a non-existent snapshot
   - Verify application handles error gracefully

2. **State Transition Failures**:
   - Force an invalid state transition
   - Verify state remains consistent
   - Check error logging and reporting

## Security Verification

1. **Role-Based Access Control**:
   - Attempt to access restricted features as non-privileged user
   - Verify access is denied appropriately

2. **State Manipulation Prevention**:
   - Attempt to directly manipulate state via console
   - Verify integrity checks prevent unauthorized changes
